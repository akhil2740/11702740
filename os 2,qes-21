/*Ques. 20. Consider that a system has P resources of same type. These resources are shared by Q processes time to time. 
All processes request and release the resources one at a time.Generate a solution to demonstrate that, 
the system is in safe state when following conditions are satisfied. 
Conditions: 
1.  Maximum resource need of each process is between 1 and P. 
2. Summation of all maximum needs is less than P+Q */
